## Introduction

This is a template repo for projects built with `react` and `typescript` on the basis of `vite`.

This template also uses Protected Route plus Authentication and Public Route in ReactJS, and applies Redux and Redux-Saga for React Web App.

## Dependencies

## Development

To get a local copy of the code, clone it using git:

```

```

Make it your own:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
